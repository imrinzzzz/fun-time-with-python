    "# Introduction to Git and GitHub (version control system)\n",
    "Git is a version control system for tracking changes\n",
    "in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.\n",
    "Git is very popular in many groups e.g. computer scientist, software developer,\n",
    "data scientist. In other words, when we work with friends, we need a way to\n",
    "save it and keep track of each change made to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use Git command line?\n",
    "There are GUIs for Git. But for the sake of looking oh-so-smart, we're gonna go through all the CODES, so suck it up. (wasn't written by Aj obv). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key terms for Git and GitHub\n",
    "- **Repository(repo)**:  \n",
    "    is just a file _location_ where you are storing all the files related to your project.     \n",
    "    When you are working with Git, you have two repositories - **Local** & **Remote**.    \n",
    "    > **Local repository**: a file location in your system. When you **git commit** your code, a version/snapshot is created in your local repo.\n",
    "    >\n",
    "    > **Remote repository**: A remote repository generally lies somewhere outside your system, on a remote machine. This is the place where everyone will be sharing their code. you can add files in your remote repo by **git push** from your local repository.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Repositories can have multiple collaborators (e.g. your friends), and can be either public or private.   \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Clone**:   \n",
    "    is a copy of a repository that keep _on your computer_ instead of on Git server. With your clone you can edit the files in and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online.   \n",
    "    You can push your local changes to the remote (i.e. files in the Git server) to keep them synced.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Working Directory**:   \n",
    "    refers to your local version of files on your computer, where you make changes.   \n",
    "    All Git files have a three part working directory: unstaged, staged, committed.    \n",
    "    When you edit files in your repo, those files sit in `unstaged` until you add those changes to the `staging` area. Those changes will be changed to `commit` after your committing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Commit**:     \n",
    "    refers to the changing of files. It is like when you save a file on Git. (Each commit usually has a commit message to briefly describe of what changes were made.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Push or pushing**:    \n",
    "    refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository e.g., GitHub.com.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Pull or pulling**:    \n",
    "    is used in updating your local files with the changes from a remote server.\n",
    "    \n",
    "So yeah, we will use GitHub.com as our repository. GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as its own social network features. This is the web interface for the remote, shared version of your project(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Git\n",
    "Open the Anaconda Prompt and remember to run it as the administrator. You\n",
    "need to check whether Git is installed in your machine by:   \n",
    "    Type `git --version`\n",
    "    \n",
    "If Git was not installed, to install git use:    \n",
    "    Type `conda install git`\n",
    "    \n",
    "type `cd\\` to go back to the base directory.\n",
    "Then, type `git config --list` to see the current configuration of Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following commands to configure your local Git installation. Type.. \n",
    "```\n",
    "git config --global user.name <YOUR NAME>\n",
    "git config --global user.email <YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>\n",
    "```\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "```git\n",
    "git config --global user.name morakot   \n",
    "git config --global user.email morakot.cho@mahidol.ac.th\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, type `git config --list` again to check whether the configurations\n",
    "are successfully added.    \n",
    "`git help` is the Git command to call for HELP!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a local git repository\n",
    "To begin, at the Anaconda Prompt, you have to make sure that you are working on `C:\\`.   \n",
    "Type `mkdir myproject <your student ID>` to create your working directory.   \n",
    "You can check whether the folder is created using `dir` and find the folder\n",
    "in the list.\n",
    "Let's assume that your student ID is 4688021.\n",
    "Type `cd myproject 4688021`   \n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize a git repository in the root of the folder, run the `git init` command:\n",
    "Type `git init`   \n",
    "Type `git status` to check the current status of your repository\n",
    "\n",
    "## Add a new file\n",
    "Git will notice that changes have been\n",
    "made inside the repository. But, Git won’t officially keep track of the file, unless\n",
    "you explicitly tell it to\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new file, you can type `notepad MyFirstCode.txt`.     \n",
    "Note that you use text files as running examples since it can be considered as text file\n",
    "encoding like source code in many programming languages.    \n",
    "(Note that, if you\n",
    "use MacOS, you can use `vi MyFirstCode.txt` (ask Google for how to use vi in\n",
    "MacOS).)\n",
    "\n",
    "In your text file (i.e. MyFirstCode.txt), add some simple sentence like `Hello world!` and save it. Make sure that you save the file in the folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, type `git status` to check the current status of your repository.\n",
    "Now, `MyFirstCode.txt` is in **untracked stage**.    \n",
    "To include the file to the\n",
    "**staging** environment using the git add command, type `git add .` or `git add MyFirstCode.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a commit\n",
    "When you reach a point where you want to sum up the progress of your work in preparation for sharing, you do a commit.\n",
    "This takes the files as they are in the _staging area_ and stores the _staged snapshot_\n",
    "permanently to your local Git directory. This is done with the command git\n",
    "commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type `git commit -m \"this is my first commit from <your studentID>\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing good _commit messages_ is important because each commit you make to your repository\n",
    "helps to generate a log of your activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type `git status`, to check if it is in the committed stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's change `MyFirstCode.txt` a little bit to see how Git handle changes. Type\n",
    "`notepad MyFirstCode.txt` and add `\"The faculty of Information and Communication Technology\"` as a new text in the file and save the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `git diff` to check the differences between the **committed stage**\n",
    "and the **current changes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then use git\n",
    "status and git diff to check your Git.\n",
    "You can type `git log` to check the _commit log_ and _commit messages_.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a new branch\n",
    "Assume that you want to make a new feature for your application but you worry\n",
    "about making changes to the main project while you are developing the new\n",
    "feature. This is where git branches can help you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branches** allow you to move back and forth between `states` of a project. For\n",
    "example, if you want to add a new page to your website you can create a new\n",
    "branch just for that page **without affecting** the main part of the project.   \n",
    "Once you’re done with the page, you can merge your changes from your branch into\n",
    "the _master branch_.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The **master branch** is the _default branch_ when you create a repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new branch named myNewFeature and switch to it.    \n",
    "Type `git checkout -b myNewFeature`\n",
    "Type `git branch` to check which branch you are working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that the `*` appears at `myNewFeature`, rather than master.   \n",
    "Use `git status` to confirm which branch you are working again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will edit the file `MyFirstCode.txt` in the `myNewFeature` branch.   \n",
    "Type `notepad MyFirstCode.txt` and add `“This is my new feature”` as the new\n",
    "text and save the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's commit the change to the `myNewFeature` branch by adding commit message\n",
    "as `“my commit to the myNewFeature branch”`.     \n",
    "Now, you can check the differences between the current branch \n",
    "and the master branch using `git diff master myNewFeature`.    \n",
    "Next, you can move to the master branch by typing `git checkout master`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type `type MyFirstCode.txt` to print text in the MyFirstCode text file.\n",
    "(Note that in MacOS, you can use `cat MyFirstCode.txt`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you need to **merge** the new feature to the **master**. To merge\n",
    "another branch into your active branch (i.e., master),  \n",
    "use `git merge myNewFeature`\n",
    "After merging, check the current text on your file by typing `type MyFirstCode.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conflict handling\n",
    "Often, merge conflicts happen when people make\n",
    "different changes to the same line of the same file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type `git checkout master`, to make sure that you are working on the master.   \n",
    "`notepad MyFirstCode.txt` and add `“add from the master”` to the text and\n",
    "save.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git add .` and `git commit -m \"commit from master\"`, to commit the\n",
    "change.   \n",
    "`git checkout myNewFeature`, to change to another branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "`notepad MyFirstCode.txt` and add `“add from the myNewFeature”` to the\n",
    "text and save.   \n",
    "`git add .` and `git commit -m \"commit from myNewFeature\"`, to commit\n",
    "the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's go back to master and do merging.    \n",
    "type `git checkout master` and `git merge myNewFeature`.   \n",
    "(use `git status` and `git diff` to check what’s wrong).\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving conflicts in Git is an art. You can either fix it manually or use tools.\n",
    "Now, we will **abort** this merge by typing `git merge --abort`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a new repository on GitHub\n",
    "If you want to work with a team, you can use GitHub to collaboratively\n",
    "modify the project’s code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new repo on GitHub, log in and go to the GitHub home page.\n",
    "You should see a green `New repository` button. After clicking the button,\n",
    "GitHub will ask you to name your repo and provide a brief description.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can name your repo like `ITCS159 <your student ID>`.\n",
    "When you’re done filling out the information, press the `Create repository`\n",
    "button to make your new repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub will ask if you want to create a new repo from scratch or if you want\n",
    "to add a repo you have created locally. In this case, since we’ve already created\n",
    "a new repo locally, we want to **push** that onto GitHub so follow the `....or push\n",
    "an existing repository from the command line` section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following command to set your remote repo and push your project\n",
    "to remote repo hosted by GitHub. \n",
    "```\n",
    "git remote add origin https://github.com/<your username>/ITCS159_<your studentid>.git\n",
    "git push -u origin master\n",
    "```\n",
    "Please make sure that your URL is correct!. If you you find the\n",
    "connection warning, you stay behind the university’s firewall. Please try it at\n",
    "home or using MU-WiFi. After you pushed your local repo to GitHub,\n",
    "check your project on the GitHub website."
