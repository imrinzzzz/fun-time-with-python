    "# Lab 1: setting up python\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language. There are two basic mode for using Python.\n",
    "1. **normal mode (commonly used)** <br>\n",
    "    which is about creating script file “.py” where Python statements are written for a specific task and run this file in Python interpreter.\n",
    "2.  **Python interactive mode** <br>\n",
    "    which is a command line shell where each of input statement will be executed and gives immediate feedback after submission\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Python Interactive Shell\n",
    "You should set up a PATH first. To open the shell, press `windows + R`, type `cmd` then type `python` and hit return. Or if you haven't set up a path, press `windows + R`, type `cmd` then type `cd Anaconda3` and type `python` and hit return. <br>\n",
    "The display should look like this\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Python 3.6.5 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Mar 29 2018, 13:32:41)\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once the Python interactive shell is started, you can issue any command at the command prompt `>>>`. To quit the python shell, you can type `exit()` or Press `(Ctrl+Z)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at some commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Printing\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print(\"Hello world\")\n",
    ">>> print(\n",
    "... \"Test123\"\n",
    "... );\n",
    ">>> print(\"Hello world\"); \\\n",
    "... print(\"My name is <YourName>\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### String\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# you can combine String like this\n",
    ">>> print(\"Hello world\" + \"This is python class\")  # python doesn't add whitespace\n",
    "\n",
    "# len() counts characters in a string\n",
    ">>> print(len(\"Hello world\" +\" \"+\"This is python class\")); \\\n",
    "... print(len(\"Helloworld\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Value <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, variable can be initialized and assigned the value by:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> fruit = \"Mango\";\n",
    ">>> print(fruit);\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once the variable is assigned the value, it can be updated by setting it to a new\n",
    "value\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> fruit = \"Orange\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Numbers\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print(5);\\\n",
    ">>> print(1.55);\\\n",
    ">>> print(True);\n",
    "```\n",
    "Every element in Python has it own type that determine the operation supported by the element. <br>\n",
    "- bool&emsp;True or False.\n",
    "- int&emsp;&emsp;Whole number value such as 3.4141 or -2.234.\n",
    "- float&emsp; Numeric value with the decimal point such as 587 or -45.\n",
    "- str&emsp;&emsp;String of characters inside the quote (usually double quote is used)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = \"100\";\\\n",
    ">>> y = \"250\";\\\n",
    ">>> print(x+y);\n",
    ">>> print(x, y);\n",
    "```\n",
    "The result is `100250` and `100 250` <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Many times number are kept inform of **String** values. The conversion is needed before use mathematical operation.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "int(x)    # Convert x to an integer number (discard all fragment parts).\n",
    "float(x)  # Convert x to a floating-point number.\n",
    "str(x)    # Convert x to a String.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> x = \"100\";\\\n",
    ">>> y = \"250\";\\\n",
    ">>> print(int(x)+int(y));\n",
    "```\n",
    "The result is `350`\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> year = 2018 ; faculty_name = ’ICT’;\n",
    ">>> print(\"The faculty of {faculty_name} year {year}\");\n",
    ">>> print(f\"The faculty of {faculty_name} year {year}\"); # what does f do?\n",
    "```\n",
    "output: <br>\n",
    "`The faculty of {faculty_name} year {year}\"` <br>\n",
    "`The faculty of ICT year 2018\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Read and Write Files <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic concept of file writing is dealing with file object by using the **open**, **read**, **write**, and close methods.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# How to write file\n",
    ">>> file = open(\"../Desktop/testfile.txt\", \"w\");\n",
    ">>> file.write(\"Hello, This is my file\");\n",
    ">>> file.write(\"\\n--- nextline ---\");\n",
    ">>> file.close();\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to read file\n",
    ">>> file = open(\"../Desktop/testfile.txt\", \"r\");\n",
    ">>> read_1 = file.read();\n",
    ">>> read_2 = file.read(5);\n",
    ">>> read_3 = file.readline();\n",
    ">>> read_4 = file.readline();\n",
    ">>> file.close();\n",
    "# use print() command to display all variable named read 1, read 2, read 3, and read 4\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to append file\n",
    ">>> file = open(\"../Desktop/testfile.txt\", \"a\");\n",
    ">>> file.write(\"\\n -- append --\");\n",
    ">>> file.close();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Script\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned at the beginning, there is a common way of writing python code. The python script is about writing a set of Python statement into a file with extension \"**.py**\". (You can use notepad)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"This is my first Python program\");\n",
    "num1 = 2; num2 =3;\n",
    "sum=num1+num2;\n",
    "print(f\"The result of {num1}+{num2}={sum}\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "Save this as \"filename.py\" <br>\n",
    "In order to run this file, press `windows + R`, type `cmd` and hit return. When the shell is open, type the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "python ../Desktop/filename.py\n",
    "```"
